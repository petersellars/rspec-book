# TO-DO

* Tag the initial version (Working Version)
* Check ServerSpec version update in plugin works
* Tidy up and clean the README.md file
* Look at moving the librarian-puppet to manage the puppet module folder
(use puppet module list)
* Utilise auto update so that a manual fix is not needed when using vagrant 
up (4.10)
* Decide if [vagrant-hosts](https://github.com/adrienthebo/vagrant-hosts) 
should be used instead of vagrant-hostupdater, as this changes after the box
is loaded (although serverspec tests seem to pass!)

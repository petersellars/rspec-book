Provisioning code to establish a Vagrant environment using Puppet with
Librarian-Puppet to create a box for building and running the code from
'The RSpec Book'

### TODO:

* Test the box can run rspec and cucumber tests then Tag it!
* Investigate VirtualBox update due to box/new version of Virtualbox guest additions
* Look at moving the librarian-puppet to manage the puppet module folder (use puppet module list)
